    <h2>The Collective Social Brain Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>This hypothesis states that individuals strongly tend to fall into either one of two groups. One of these groups tends to identify with a vulnerable group and think that the solution to problems related to social protection and provision is more rights to that protection and provision. In this sense, this group sees these issues as outside one’s control and tends to see anyone that tries to (in their view) incorrectly assign responsibility as being hateful and engaging in victim-blaming. The other of these groups tends not to identify as vulnerable and tends to think that the solution to problems related to social protection and provision is taking more personal responsibility for ensuring that protection and provision for ourselves and our loved ones. In this sense, this group sees issues as within one’s control and tends to see anyone that tries to (in their view) place blame on others as being detestable and seeking to undermine their cherished values. Each of these groups uses different reasoning styles in coming to their conclusions. The group that prioritizes rights tends to use type I (intuitive) reasoning in coming to conclusions in these matters. Type I reasoning is useful for solving uncomputable problems by detecting patterns of solutions observed in the past where any calculations or logic don’t reflect the complexity of the issue. For example, these individuals might say there is no calculation that can determine whether a statement is “racist”, and that a statement is racist if the recipient feels it to be so. Type I reasoning is also very good at reaching consensus. This is effective for high signal to noise problems (problems for which the correct answer lies within the majority), where the solutions to those problems are uncomputable (answers cannot be reached through any algorithm and instead must be reached by detecting patterns of solutions observed in the past). For example in a group of one thousand people, if nine hundred and ninety nine of them are farmers, and you ask them a question about agriculture related legislation, you might be most likely to get the correct answer through consensus.</p>

    <p>The group that prioritizes rights tends to use type II (logical) reasoning in coming to conclusions in these same matters. This doesn’t mean that their reasoning is logical in any absolute sense. It just means that their reasoning is a methodical combination of component reasoning processes. Type II reasoning is effective for low signal to noise problems (problems for which the correct answer lies within a minority), where the solutions to those problems are computable (answers can be reached through some algorithm). For example in the same group of one thousand people, if you ask a question about general relativity, you might be more likely to get the correct answer by completely ignoring the consensus and asking the one theoretical physicist in the group. For this group, a question about general relativity is a low signal to noise problem because the correct answer lies within the minority.</p>

    <p>These reasoning types simply come to different conclusions given the same information. An example is the case of COVID-19, in which individuals who feel vulnerable might be biased toward prioritizing their right to be protected by their governments, and they might be strongly predisposed toward arguments that use Type I reasoning in adhering to the views espoused by those appointed as “experts” by individuals with the same cognitive bias they have. Individuals who feel responsible for their own protection as well as the protection of others, on the other hand, might not believe the government has as much ability to ensure all aspects of their well being (physical, emotional, financial, etc.) as they do themselves. The natural result is that the first group will conclude that stronger lock-down measures are “logical”, while the second group will conclude that more freedom is “logical”. Any surveys or scientific research conducted by the Type I group will generally ignore any reports that have not been approved by a consensus among those they consider to be “experts”, and reports from informal sources regarding negative impacts on well-being that occur because of the measures they recommend (such as financial stability and mental health) are likely to be labeled as fake news or misinformation. Any surveys or scientific research conducted by the Type II group will generally ignore any “expert consensus” and will consider any arguments they find logical. The fact that in their view the people they are trying to convince (the Type I group) simply do not receive information that is not framed in terms of the rights of vulnerable groups to protection, and that doesn’t enjoy a consensus among acknowledged experts, is likely to be labeled as being confined to groupthink.</p>

    <p>For those who understand the importance of consensus, and the importance of filtering out conclusions which lack consensus, it’s important to point out that the collective social brain does not and is not meant to account for all individual differences in beliefs, attitudes, or reasoning styles. People’s attitudes and reasoning styles can also change over time and context. The collective social brain hypothesis also is not meant to sweep away the complexity of human thought and societal dynamics. It is however a powerful force that shapes these dynamics. While the distinction between intuitive and logical reasoning is widely recognized, tying them to certain social attitudes might not be. However, though this tie dominates experimental observations, it does not mean that people can’t use both intuitive and logical reasoning regardless of their attitudes towards social protection and provision. The powerful presence of this tie within the above groups in also does not make human thought deterministic, and therefore is not intended to undermine the complexity of human cognition.</p>

    <p>For those who understand the importance of not being confined by the need for consensus, General problem-solving ability at the individual level (true intelligence) requires both of these reasoning types (type I and type II), as well as the ability to switch between them depending on which is optimal. General problem-solving ability at the group level (true collective intelligence) also requires both these reasoning types as well as the ability to switch between them depending on which is optimal. The problem is that the mechanisms through which groups are able to switch between these two reasoning styles might only work at the small group sizes that were likely characteristic of the ancestral tribes that humans evolved in. At the size of modern civilizations, instead of switching, groups are predicted to simply polarize irreconcilably. However, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCI.2021.122707">a General Collective Intelligence or GCI platform</a> is a model for group decision-making that has the potential to provide an artificial mechanism for switching between these two reasoning types at larger group sizes. Furthermore, GCI is predicted to have the capacity to exponentially increase the general problem-solving ability of groups, and therefore is predicted to exponentially increase the ability of groups to solve any problem in general. If so, this has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-021-01297-8">profound implications on problems like poverty or climate change</a> that have not yet proved to be reliably solvable.</p>
